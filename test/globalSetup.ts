 * server docker-compose already starts (created by db/init/01-create-test-db.
 * sql). Not an ephemeral container per run, and not a mocked adapter.
 *
 *   - Real, because the things worth testing here are things a fake cannot be
 *     honest about: ON DELETE CASCADE revoking sessions, the unique index that
 *     produces the 23505 the error handler maps to 409, and Better Auth's own
 *     SQL against the column names in our migration.
 *   - Not a container per run, because Testcontainers means a large dependency,
 *     a Docker socket in CI, and seconds of startup — to reach a database
 *     `docker compose up` has already given you.
 *   - Separate database rather than separate schema, because the migration
 *     script's DDL is unqualified and would need a search_path dance.
 *
 * Test files still run in PARALLEL. Isolation comes from every test minting its
 * own identity with a random email (see helpers/auth.ts), not from serialising
 * the suite or truncating between files.
