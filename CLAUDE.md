# Fastify + TypeScript + PostgreSQL boilerplate

Cloned as the starting point for new projects. Keep these rules intact when
adding features; `README.md` has the long-form reasoning behind each one.

Two projects live in this repository:

- **the API** — this directory. Everything below applies to it.
- **the frontend** — `web/`, a Next.js 16 app. It has its OWN package.json,
  lockfile, tsconfig, eslint config, Dockerfile and `CLAUDE.md`. Read
  `web/CLAUDE.md` before touching anything under `web/`; none of the rules
  below apply there, and none of its rules apply here. Nothing imports across
  the boundary — the only contract between them is HTTP.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Node runs `.ts` directly (type stripping), no tsx/ts-node
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`; run after any series of edits
- `npm run test:unit` — `app.inject()`, **no database required**
- `npm run test:integration` — needs Postgres up (`docker compose up -d`)
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`
- `npm run db:generate` — generate a migration after editing `src/db/schema.ts`

Before calling a change done: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test:unit`.

For the frontend, `cd web && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build`.

## Conventions that differ from the obvious default

- **Relative imports carry the `.ts` extension** (`./user.service.ts`), not `.js`
  and not extensionless. `allowImportingTsExtensions` + `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`
  handle the build.
- **No enums, namespaces, or constructor parameter properties** — Node's type
  stripping cannot erase them.
- **`import type` is required** for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`).
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is on: pass an optional field by spreading
  (`...(x === undefined ? {} : { x })`), never as an explicit `undefined`.
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is on: index access yields `T | undefined`.
- `no-console` is an ESLint error. Log through `request.log` / `app.log`.
- Prettier: 90 columns, double quotes, ES5 trailing commas.

## Architectural rules

**1. `fp()` means shared, plain means private.**
Everything in `src/plugins/` is wrapped in `fastify-plugin` so its decorators
reach the root instance. Nothing in `src/modules/` is wrapped — each route file
gets a child scope. Do not wrap a route plugin.

**2. Authorize by scope, not by repetition.**
Declare `app.addHook("onRequest", app.requireAuth)` once inside a nested
`register`, and every route in that scope inherits it. Never add a per-route
auth check where a scope would do. Per-route `preHandler: app.requireRole(...)`
is for *authorization* on top of that scope.

**3. Only `src/config/index.ts` reads `process.env`.**
Everything else imports `config`. Adding a variable means adding it to the Zod
schema there, to `.env.example`, and to `.env.test` if tests need it.

**4. `src/db/schema.ts` is the single table definition.**
Drizzle queries, migrations, and Better Auth all read it. Better Auth owns the
`users`/`sessions`/`accounts` tables — read them freely, but never write `email`
or anything on `accounts` outside Better Auth's own flows.

**5. Modules are `routes -> service -> repository`.**
Routes declare schemas and format responses. Services hold business rules and
take deps as a `Ctx` argument (never import a singleton pool). Repositories hold
Drizzle queries and a `toDto` mapper. Use the `new-module` skill to scaffold one.

**6. Zod schemas are the response serializer.**
A field absent from the response schema is *dropped* from the payload. If a
value is missing from a response, check the schema before debugging the handler.

**7. Errors: throw the helpers in `src/lib/errors.ts`** (`notFound`, `badRequest`,
`conflict`, …). The error handler plugin renders the envelope. Return
`ok(data, message)` / `paginated(...)` from `src/lib/api-response.ts` on success.

## The frontend contract

The four things about `web/` that this side has to hold up, in one place:

1. **`BETTER_AUTH_URL` is the FRONTEND's origin**, not an `api.` hostname. The
   Next app serves `/api/auth/*` on its own origin and forwards it here (a
   rewrite in development, Caddy in production), so the browser only ever sees
   one origin. Better Auth builds the Google `redirect_uri`, the verification
   link and the reset link from this value, and all three have to land where the
   session cookie is. `FRONTEND_URL` and `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` are that same origin.
2. **Better Auth's response shape is load-bearing.** `auth.routes.ts` returns it
   untouched because the frontend's Better Auth client SDK parses exactly that.
   Wrapping those routes in the house envelope breaks every SDK call.
3. **`GET /api/auth/providers` is public and is how the UI knows what to draw.**
   The frontend does not carry its own "is Google enabled" flag — it asks. Add a
   provider to `socialProviders` in `auth.factory.ts` and add it to that route's
   `social` list in the same edit, or the button never appears.
4. **`GET /api/auth/me` is the frontend's session read**, in the house envelope.
   Its DTO is mirrored in `web/src/lib/api/schemas.ts` and parsed at runtime —
   change the DTO here and change it there in the same commit.
5. **`details[]` on a 400 is a UI feature.** The frontend maps each
   `{ field, message }` onto the form field that produced it, so a strict-object
   rejection shows up under the input rather than as a toast.

## Security invariants — do not relax without being asked

- `role` is writable only through the admin-guarded `PATCH /:id`. Self-service
  bodies must not contain it, and the service for them must not accept it.
- Listing users is admin-only; the rows carry email addresses.
- Update bodies use `z.strictObject` so an unknown key is a 400, not a silent
  strip. Keep new update schemas strict.
- Never interpolate user input into SQL. Escape LIKE metacharacters (`%`, `_`,
  `\`) when building patterns — see `escapeLikePattern` in `user.repository.ts`.
